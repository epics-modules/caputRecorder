<a name="Overview"></a> <h2>Overview</h2> <P>caputRecorder supports the recording
and playback of sequences of caputs.  It records each caput as a <a
href="https://www.python.org/">python</a> command, and a sequence of caputs as a
python function&mdash;also called here a <b><i>macro</i></b>.  caputRecorder can
also serve as a simple user interface for delivering canned python functions to
end users.  caputRecorder communicates with users via an EPICS database, so it
allows any EPICS record or channel-access client to record and run python
functions, and to wait for them to complete.

<blockquote><font size="-1">

<i>caput</i> is short for "Channel Access put".  When you press a button, or make
a menu selection, in an MEDM (or other display manager) display, you are doing a
caput.  Any program that writes to EPICS PVs does so by doing caputs.

</font></blockquote>

<P>caputRecorder also supports generalizing recorded macros with arguments. 
(This requires manual editing of python code.) It provides a user interface
through which macro arguments are displayed with default values that can be
changed via channel access.

<P>This version of caputRecorder is known to work with python 2.7.  It probably
will not work with python 3.

<P>caputRecorder is intended to meet the following kinds of needs:

<ul> <li><P>Automate measurements involving sequences of steps that users know how
to do manually, but for which no software has been written.  If users can do a
measurement step manually while the recorder is on, they will in effect have
written software to automate that step, and they can then combine several such
steps as needed to perform a particular instance of the measurement type.

<li><P>Improve communication between users and the software developers who
support them.  Rather than describing needed software in general terms, or
laboriously listing the required actions in the required order, a user can
simply record them, with comments for any actions outside of EPICS, and send the
developer the python code.

<li><P>Assist in troubleshooting, by recording exact sequences of caputs that
do and do not reproduce a problem.

<li><P>Automate testing, by recording sequences of caputs that succeed with the
current version of some software, and playing them back to verify that they also
succeed with the new version.

<li><P>Show someone how to operate a complicated device by operating it
yourself, while recording, and emailing them the python code.

<li><P>Record everything a user does.  (But <a
href="http://www-csr.bessy.de/control/SoftDist/caPutLog">caPutLog</a> is a
<i>much</i> better tool for this purpose.)

</ul>

<a name="How does this work"></a>
<H2> How does this work? </h2>

EPICS access security has the ability to call a user function whenever a caput
that meets certain criteria is received by an IOC.  The function is called an
<i>access-security trap listener</i>, and caputRecorder provides one which
writes a <i>caput-notification</i> string of the form "pvname,value,user@host"
to an EPICS PV whenever an eligible caput is received by the IOC.

<p>caputRecorder provides an EPICS database that contains the EPICS PV mentioned
above, and other PVs that function as caputRecorder's user interface.  The
user-interface PVs are monitored by the python program caputRecorder.py, and
direct its operation.  When caputRecorder.py is given a macro name and told
to record, it begins monitoring the caput-notification PVs of specified IOCs,
and writes python commands corresponding to each notification into the python
program file macros.py.  Here's what a typical command looks like:

<blockquote>
<pre>
epics.caput("xxx:scan1.P1PV","xxx:m2.VAL", wait=True, timeout=1000000.0)
</pre>

This writes the string "xxx:m2.VAL" to "xxx:scan1.P1PV", and waits ~forever for
any EPICS processing that might result from the command to complete.

</blockquote>

<P>caputRecorder.py also inspects the file macros.py and writes the names of
macros in the file to a set of EPICS menus (that is, to the menu-string fields
of mbbo records).  A user can select a macro name from those menus, and tell
caputRecorder to execute that macro.

<P>Thus, each IOC is responsible for telling caputRecorder that it received a
caput, and one IOC also hosts the database through which the user tells
caPutRecorder what to do.

<a name="Requirements, configuration"></a>
<H2>Requirements, configuration</h2>

The caputRecorder database uses record types from the synApps
<a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/busy/busy.html">busy</a>
and
<a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/calc/calc.html">calc</a>
modules.

The workstation on which caputRecorder.py runs must have python with
the <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/python/pyepics3">PyEpics</a>
module installed.

<P>EPICS IOCs that participate in caputRecorder, either by posting the caputs
they receive, or by hosting the database that functions as caputRecorder's user
interface, must be prepared as follows.  (These are excerpts from the synApps
xxx module, release R5-8, which is already configured to use caputRecorder.)

<ol>
<li><P>Add <code>CAPUTRECORDER</code> to the IOC's RELEASE file

<li><P>Include <code>caputRecorder.dbd</code> in the IOC's .dbd file.

<li><P>Link the IOC's code against the <code>caputRecorder</code> library.

<li><P>Load the database <code>caputPoster.db</code>

<blockquote>
<pre>
dbLoadRecords("$(CAPUTRECORDER)/caputRecorderApp/Db/caputPoster.db","P=xxx:,N=300")
</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
where <code>N</code> is the length of the longest caput-notification string
("pvname,value,user@host") that will be sent to the recorder.
</blockquote>

<li><P>If this IOC will host caputRecorder's user interface, load the database
<code>caputRecorder.db</code>

<blockquote>
<pre>
dbLoadRecords("$(CAPUTRECORDER)/caputRecorderApp/Db/caputRecorder.db","P=xxx:,N=100")
</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
where <code>N</code> is the length of the comment, users, hosts, and prefixes
strings.

<P>If you're using autosave, you'll probably also want to include
<code>caputRecorder_settings.req</code> in the IOC's
<code>auto_settings.req</code> file:

<pre>
file caputRecorder_settings.req P=xxx:,N=100
</pre>

If you do this, you must also add the following line to save_restore.cmd:

<pre>
set_requestfile_path("$(CAPUTRECORDER)", "caputRecorderApp/Db")
</pre>

</blockquote>

<li>Register caputRecorder's access-security trap listener.  (Note that this
command must be executed <i>after</i> iocInit.)

<blockquote>
<pre>
registerCaputRecorderTrapListener("xxx:caputRecorderCommand")
</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

where <code>xxx:caputRecorderCommand</code> is the name of the PV to which
caput-notification strings will be written.

</blockquote>

<li>Run EPICS access security with an access-security file that specifies
<code>TRAPWRITE</code> for the desired users and hosts.

<blockquote>
<pre>
iocsh
asSetFilename("$(TOP)/iocBoot/accessSecurity.acf")
exit
</pre>
</blockquote>

where the file <code>accessSecurity.acf</code> might have the following content:

<blockquote>
<pre>
HAG(workstation) {mooneylinux.aps.anl.gov}
UAG(user) {mooney}
ASG(DEFAULT) {
	RULE(1,READ)
	RULE(1,WRITE,TRAPWRITE) {
		HAG(workstation)
		UAG(user)
	}
	RULE(1,WRITE)
}
</pre>

<P>This file grants write permission to anybody on any host, and specifies that
TRAPWRITE is in effect only for user <i>mooney</i> on workstation
<i>mooneylinux</i>.  For the purposes of caputRecorder, you probably don't want
TRAPWRITE in effect for caputs from an IOC, but do want it for caputs from
channel-access clients, such as MEDM, that aren't in an IOC.

<P>Note that the order in which rules occur in the file matters for TRAPWRITE. 
If <code>RULE(1,WRITE)</code> were encountered before
<code>RULE(1,WRITE,TRAPWRITE)</code>, TRAPWRITE would not be in effect for
anybody, because everybody is covered by <code>RULE(1,WRITE)</code>.

<P>If you can't or don't want to select users and hosts using access-security
rules, you can specify TRAPWRITE for all, and select users and hosts with
caputRecorder's user interface.  The simplest possible access-security file that
will work for caputRecorder is the following:

<pre>
ASG(DEFAULT) {
	RULE(1,WRITE,TRAPWRITE)
}
</pre>
</blockquote>


<P><li>The following environment variables must be set before running MEDM
(caQtDM, etc.):
<dl> 

<P><dt>START_PUTRECORDER<dd>The path to a script that starts caputRecorder.py. 
This will be used by the "!(re)start recorder" button described below.  There is
a sample copy of a script that does this for Linux here:

<pre>caputRecorder/example_start_putrecorder</pre>

It is important that only one copy of caputRecorder.py (for a given
user-interface database) is running at a time. caputRecorder.py detects the
launch of a new copy of itself that uses the same control PVs, and exits.


<P><dt>MACROS_PY<dd>The path to the macros file, in which caputs will be
recorded.  There is an example copy of this file here:
<pre>caputRecorder/caputRecorderApp/op/python/example_macros.py</pre>

<P><dt>EDITOR<dd>The command that invokes your preferred editor, which will be
used for the "edit macros" button described below.

</dl>

</ol>

<a name="How to use"></a>
<h2>How to use</h2>

<P><center><IMG SRC="caputRecorder.adl.jpg"><br>caputRecorder.adl</IMG></center>

<P>Referring to the caputRecorder.adl display above, from top to bottom:

<ul>

<li><P>The button labelled "!(re)start recorder" starts or restarts the python
program caputRecorder.py.

<li><P>The heart symbol to the right of the "!(re)start recorder" button blinks
while caputRecorder.py is running and responsive to its control PVs.

<li><P><b>Inputs</b>

<ul>


<li><P>The text-monitor field labelled "caput:" displays the PV name and value
most recently written to the IOC.  This field is written to by the
access-security trap listener, and is updated whether or not a python
macro is being recorded.

<li><P>The text-entry field labelled "comment:" allows you to add comments to
the macro being recorded.  This field is monitored only while a macro is being
recorded.

<li><P>The text-entry field labelled "delay" specifies the time delay in seconds
of the delay command that will be added to the macro being recorded when you
press the "Add" button.  The actual python code for this command will be
something like <code>time.sleep(1.200)</code>.  After caputRecorder.py has
written the delay command, it will press the "Done" button.

</ul>

<li><P><b>Record Macro</b> <ul> <li><P>The text-entry field labelled "macro name"
specifies the name of the macro (python function) you will record.

<blockquote>

By default, you aren't permitted to use a macro name that already exists in
macros.py.  (See <a href="#Record options">Record options</a>.)

<P>Also note that the macro name must start with a letter, and must consist of
letters digits, and underscores.  caputRecorder will enforce this by prepending
"a" and/or replacing offending characters with underscores.  The macro name will
be truncated to 25 characters; this limit is set by the length of an mbboRecord's
menu-string field.

</blockquote>

<li><P>The choice button labelled "record puts" is used to start and stop
recording.  While recording, you can write to EPICS PVs via any EPICS client,
and you can also execute any macro that has already been recorded.

<li><P>If you execute macro <b>A</b> while recording macro <b>B</b>, and then
stop recording while macro <b>A</b> is still executing, caputRecorder will make
you wait for macro <b>A</b> to finish before allowing you to start a new
recording of another macro.

<li><P>When you execute macro <b>A</b> while recording macro <b>B</b>,
caputRecorder will suppress recording of the caputs that result from the
execution of macro <b>A</b>, and will simply record a function call to macro
<b>A</b>.

</ul>

<li><P><b>Select Macro</b>

<ul>

<li><P>The button labelled "edit macros" invokes the command named by
the environment variable EDITOR on the file macros.py.

<li><P>The gray boxes are menus, which will contain the names of recorded
macros, and they are the means by which a macro can be selected manually for
playback.  Currently caputRecorder supports six menus, each of which can hold 16
macro names.

<li><P>The text-monitor and text entry fields under the "arguments for selected
macro" label are the names and default values of the arguments, if any, of the
selected macro.  As recorded, macros have no arguments, but you can edit the
python code to add up to 20 arguments.  Only ten arguments are displayed by
caputRecorder.adl; caputRecorderExecute.adl (called up from the "Less" menu)
displays all 20. If you do add arguments, you must use the "name=value" syntax
for defining macro arguments.  For example, here is a macro definition with one
string argument, and three numeric arguments:

<pre>
def motorscan(motor="m1", start=0, end=1, npts=11):
</pre>


<li><P>Normally, you should not have to press the "Reload Macros" button,
because caputRecorder reloads automatically after a new macro has been recorded.
However, if you edit macros.py manually, you must press "Reload Macros"
to tell caputRecorder to reread the file. (If you deleted a function definition
from macros.py, reloading isn't sufficient; you must restart
caputRecorder, using the "!(re)start recorder" button.)

<li><P>The "Refresh Menus" button must be pressed whenever menus have changed. 
This happens when macro recording is done, after you press the "!(re)start
recorder" button, after you press the "Reload Menus" button, and after the
controlling IOC reboots.  caputRecorder will tell you when menus need to be
refreshed by showing the blinking text "PRESS REFRESH".  This blinking text will
go away when <i>any</i> instance of caputRecorder.adl, or
caputRecorder_small.adl, is refreshed.

</ul>

<li><P><b>Playback Macro</b>

<ul>

<li><P>The text-monitor field contains the name of the selected macro.  To play
it back (to cause python to execute it) press the "Do" button.  When the
macro has finished, the "Do" button will return to the "Done" state.  If you
want to execute the macro repeatedly, enter the number of times in the field
labelled "times."

<li><P>The "Abort" button is intended to stop an executing macro, and also to do
any other abort-related work specified in the function named "_abort" in
macros.py.  The supplied <i>example_macros.py</i> defines an abort
function that aborts scans, halts motors, and stop the scaler named "scaler1".

<li><P>Any EPICS client or record can trigger macro execution by writing a macro
name to "$(P)caputRecorderMacro", optionally writing to any argument fields, and
then writing "Do" (or the number 1) to  "$(P)caputRecorderExecuteMacro".  The
client <i>must</i> wait for completion after both writes, to ensure that
arguments have been updated before writing to them or executing the macro, and
to wait for macro execution to finish.

</ul>

</ul>

<a name="Selecting what gets recorded"></a>
<H2> Selecting what gets recorded </h2>

You probably don't want to record all caputs that happen among your IOCs and
clients, but only those done by users.  One way of filtering was shown above, in
"Requirements, configuration". User-specified filtering is easier, and can be
done at run time with caputRecorder's user interface.

<ol>

<li>You can choose which users' caputs will be recorded by specifying usernames
to <code>caputRecorderUsers</code>.  (See "Record caputs from whom?" in
the figure below.)  To disable recording from a specific user, put a minus sign
in front of the username.

<P><li>You can choose which hosts' caputs will be recorded by specifying
hostnames to <code>caputRecorderHosts</code>.  (See "Record caputs from whom?"
in the figure below.)  Only the first element of a host name need be specified.  (For
example, "mooneylinux.aps.anl.gov" is used as "mooneylinux".)

<P><li>You can choose which IOCs caputRecorder monitors, by specifying prefixes
to <code>caputRecorderPrefixes</code>.  (See "Record caputs to which IOCs?" in
the figure below.)  Unlike user and host choices, this choice does not take
effect while a macro is being recorded.  Also unlike user and host choices, this
choice is not about the sender of a caput, but about the recipient.

<P>On startup, caputRecorder monitors the iocs whose prefixes are specified on the
command line.  If <code>caputRecorderPrefixes</code> is not empty, it will
override the initial list of iocs.

<P><li>Caputs within an IOC will never be recorded, because they don't go
through access security.

<P><center><IMG SRC="caputRecorderConfigure.adl.jpg"><br>caputRecorderConfigure.adl</IMG></center>

</ol>

<a name="Record options"></a>
<H2> Record options </h2>

<ul>

<li><b>Timing</b>

<P>The timing of caputs will, in general, be different on replay than when
recorded, but you can tell caputRecorder to try to reproduce the timing.  If you
select "Yes" for "record timing of caputs?" (see diagram above), caputRecorder
will insert delays between caput commands.  You can change this setting while
recording. Note that if caputRecorder waits for completion, the required delay
time could be negative, in which case caputRecorder will insert no delay.

<li><b>Wait for completion</b>

<P>You can choose whether or not caputRecorder will wait for completion after
executing recorded caputs, by setting "wait for completion?" (see diagram
above). Note that this affects the python code written while recording, and is
not an execute-time choice. You can change this setting while recording.

<P>If you tell caputRecorder to wait for completion, you can tell it for how
long to wait, using the text-entry field labelled "wait for how long?". You can
change this time while recording.

<li><b>Behavior if macro name already exists</b>

<P>If you attempt to record a macro whose name is already defined in macros.py,
caputRecorder will do one of three things, depending on the setting of the
"if macro already exists:" switch:
<dl>

<dt><b>Fail</b><dd>Refuse to start recording, and set the Stop/Start switch back to Stop.

<dt><b>Append</b><dd>Move the macro to the end of the file, and begin appending commands to it.

<dt><b>Replace</b><dd>Delete the existing macro, and begin a new macro with that name.  In this case,
caputRecorder will write a backup copy of macros.py, named "macros.py_yymmdd-HHMMSS", where "yy..." is
the current date and time.

</dl>

</ul>

<a name="Global variables"></a>
<H2> Global variables </h2>

caputRecorder maintains a small number of EPICS PVs that can be used as global
variables in any macro.  The EPICS display for these variables is shown below.

<P><center><IMG SRC="caputRecorderGlobals.adl.jpg"><br>caputRecorderGlobals.adl</IMG></center>

<P>If wxPython is available, the variables 'filepath' and 'filename' are supported
by a file requester.  If wxPython is not available, the variables can still be
used, but values must be entered manually.

<P>The rest of the variables are generic: both a variable name and its string
value can be specified.  A macro can retrieve global variables by calling the
function _getGlobals(prefix='xxx:') (imported from caputRecorder). 
_getGlobals() returns a python dictionary with global variable names and values.  For the display above, the following dictionary would be returned:

<pre>
{'varName': 'string value',
'filename': 'abc_0838.mda',
'filepath': '/home/oxygen4/MOONEY/data'}
</pre>

<P>Here is sample code demonstrating the use of global variables in a macro:

<pre>

def testGlobals():
	g = _getGlobals("xxx:")
	print "globals=%s" % g

	filename = g['filename']
	print "filename = ", filename

</pre>

<a name="Discussion"></a>
<H2> Discussion </h2>

<ul>

<li><P>

<P>caputRecorder "reads" the macros.py file by importing it:

<pre>
import macros.py
</pre>

After macros.py has been changed, caputRecorder "rereads" it by
reloading :

<pre>
reload(macros)
</pre>

Reload will overwrite objects in the live macros module with values from
macros.py, but it will not delete any objects.  If you delete a function
definition or a global variable from macros.py, reloading won't remove it from
the live copy of the macros module; you have to restart python, which you can do
by pressing the "!(re)start recorder" button.

<li><P>
caputRecorder records a caput with the following python code:

<pre>
epics.caput("xxx:scan1.P1PV","xxx:m2.VAL", wait=True, timeout=1000000.0)
</pre>

This code will request a completion callback from EPICS, and will wait ~forever
for the callback to arrive.

<P>Currently, it is not an error for a macro to timeout while waiting for a
callback.  Python will simply move on to the next command and execute it.
Currently, caputRecorder does not take advantage of PyEpics' ability to execute
several commands and then wait for all to complete (that is, the "use_complete"
option of the PV class's put() method).

<li><P><a href="http://www-csr.bessy.de/control/SoftDist/caPutLog">caPutLog</a>
can also trap caputs and write them to a PV.  A proof-of-principle
implementation of caputRecorder used caPutLog 3.4 to do this, but it didn't
handle long strings.

<li><P>In EPICS 3.14.12.4 and earlier, and in versions of 3.15 earlier than
3.15.2, access security did not provide the data from a caput to the
asTrapListener, so caputRecorder used dbGetField() to get the data after it had
been written. This was ok for most PVs, but some PVs (for example, the tweak
fields of a motor record) have their values changed immediately after being
written, and caputRecorder was getting the final value, rather than the value
the user actually wrote.  Andrew Johnson fixed this by providing data to the
asTrapListener, and caputRecorder R1-4 and later will use this capability if it
is present.

<li><P>caputRecorder R1-4 monitors the connection status of one of its PVs, and
exits if that PV remains disconnected for more than 10 seconds.

<li><P>The EDM display-file translation failed at the adl file's "shell command",
so I just deleted those items from the EDM displays.

<li><P>You can run more than one instance of caputRecorder in an IOC (but
only one copy per IOC of caputPoster.db is supported). To run two
instances of caputRecorder, you must give them different prefixes:

<pre>
dbLoadRecords("$(CAPUTRECORDER)/caputRecorderApp/Db/caputPoster.db","P=xxx:,N=300")
dbLoadRecords("$(CAPUTRECORDER)/caputRecorderApp/Db/caputRecorder.db","P=xxx:,N=100")
dbLoadRecords("$(CAPUTRECORDER)/caputRecorderApp/Db/caputRecorder.db","P=xxx<font color=red>A</font>:,N=100")
...
iocInit
...
registerCaputRecorderTrapListener('xxx:caputRecorderCommand')
</pre>

start_putRecorder must specify a different name for macros.py for the two
instances.  The example_start_putRecorder script does this as follows:

<pre>
MACROS_PY=${MACROS_PY_DIR}/"macros_"${PREFIX}.py
# start caputRecorder.py
$COMMAND ${PREFIX} ${MACROS_PY}&
</pre>

Also, you must tell the second copy to look at the one installed copy of
caputPoster.db (that is, the xxx:caputRecorderCommand PV) by specifying
the prefix in the "prefixes:" string.
</BODY>
